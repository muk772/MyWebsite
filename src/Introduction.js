          development of a platform called <b>RAAS</b>, which facilitates online
          submission of student assignments. Working as part of a team, I played
          a crucial role in <b>building the platform from scratch</b>. My

          familiarity with <b>custom hooks and the MUI library allowed</b> me to
          create a seamless and visually appealing user interface, employing
          techniques such as <b>Shimmer UI</b>. One of my notable achievements
          was the
          <b>
            development and deployment of microservices, seamlessly integrating
            them into the project
          </b>
          . My experience as a Full Stack Developer demonstrates my versatility
